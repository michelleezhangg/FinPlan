**Motivation**: Our motivation for this project is to improve financial literacy as well as make it easier for others who struggle with financial planning and budgeting. This topic has affected our entire group in its own ways, and it was a perfect way to give back to the community as well as push our own learning.

**Project Description**: A financial planning DSL where users can create budgets, investment strategies, and savings plans. Verification will ensure no overspending and that financial goals are achievable. It will help users familiarize themselves with financial terms and concepts to improve their financial literacy in a way that is tailored to their situation. Different blocks will represent different inputs and outputs regarding money, with feedback included on whether a routine or budget is feasible. It will include blocks that easily allow users to adjust their goals in case their financial situation changes.  Other examples include users who want to set up a long-term savings plan or budget given their financial situation but aren’t sure how much to cap their spending, put into savings, etc. It will also serve as a guide to help users get more in touch with their finances as well as provide an educational opportunity for the average user to understand finances more in-depth.

**Relevance to parsing, interpretation, and compilation**: When users input their financial goals and strategies, the system needs to parse that input to understand its structure and meaning. After parsing, the DSL would interpret the user's instructions to assess the feasibility of their financial plans, and offer feedback regarding their decisions. This involves running routines that verify the user's budget, savings, and investment goals. If the DSL offers the ability to produce executable strategies or visual models, then compilation would come into play, converting user-defined financial plans into a form that can be executed or displayed. Thus, the core processes of this project—taking financial plans, analyzing their viability, and possibly producing actionable strategies or visual outputs—are deeply tied to the concepts of parsing, interpretation, and compilation.
